#+TITLE: SUNRISE TChain Processing Notes

* Description
This is the code that I (Dylan Winters) used to process the BowChain/Tchain data from the Walton Smith and the two RHIBs Aries and Polly. The only adjustments needed to run this should be to things like directory names.

~proc_tchain_all.m~ looks through raw deployment folders, saves .mat files for processed deployments, and chops deployments up into survey sections. The other ~.m~ files contained here are for the main BowChain code (i.e. running ~BowChain_master('SUNRISE')~).

* Manually Applied Corrections
These were mostly done in ~SUNRISE_post_load_hook.m~.

** Walton_Smith/deploy_20210623_2235
- RBR Solo 100154 did not log and was ignored
- RBR Solo 101168 was manually masked for the later half of the deployment

** Walton_Smith/deploy_20210627
- RBR Solo 101154's clock was manually corrected using the config screenshot
- RBR Solo 101168 did not log and was ignored

** Walton_Smith/deploy_20210630_2045
- RBR Solo 101154's clock was manually corrected using the config screenshot

** Polly/deploy_20210625
- RBR Solo 207057's clock was manually corrected using the config screenshot
- RBR Solo 101179 did not log and was ignored

* Outstanding issues
** Aries/deploy_20210622
- Missing data from the lower Concerto (60088). There is some data in the .rsk file, but it appears to be from an earlier test deployment.

** Aries/deploy_20210629
- Concerto 60702 started behaving oddly mid-deployment. Strange timestamps and pressure values. Possibly salvageable for the 1st half of the deployment.
- Missing data from RBR Solo 101192


** Missing data from keel CTDs 60378 & 60380
We have one datafile from 60380, but it only contains data from later Aries deployments. I have yet to locate any files from 60378.
